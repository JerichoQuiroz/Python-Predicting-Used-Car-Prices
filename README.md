**Python Machine Learning Model Development:** Created a regression predictor to correctly predict used car prices based on 86 features.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Used dummy encoding for categorical variables and ordinal encoding for features with a large range of values. Cleaned, transformed and imputed missing data values to prepare for model training.

- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features based on existing ones to improve model accuracy.

- **Modelling and Tuning:** Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boost and Linear Regression. Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomisedSearchCV. Developed StackingRegressor that combined predictions from multiple base models to enhance predictive performance.

- **Evaluation:** Measured and evaluated model performance using MAPE

- **Visualisation:** Utilised Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation.

- **Data Manipulation:** Proficiently handled and transformed data using Pandas and NumPy.
